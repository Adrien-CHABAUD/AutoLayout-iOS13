## Goal Behind

The objective here was to being able to run the app on screens with different aspect ratios without the design being broken. By using Auto Layout allowing to set rules as how we want the view to be displayed. 

These rules allow the UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended.

## General Info

This app is a Las Vegas dice app, the same made in another repository. You can make the die roll at the press of a button.
